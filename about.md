I'm a freelance software engineer providing WebGL-based 3D graphics solutions for product visualization, engineering, medicine and BIM.

### Background

Originally from Christchurch, New Zealand, I've lived in Berlin, Germany since 2011.
<br><br>
I graduated with a degree in computer science and software engineering from the University of Canterbury in 2005. Before that, 
I studied electronic engineering at the Christchurch Polytechnic.
<br><br>
In over two decades of computing, I've taught computing at an elementary school, tutored programming at a 
university, been a CTO in San Diego, tested wind turbines in New Zealand, created two popular open source WebGL-based 3D engines, 
lead development on the [BioDigital Human]({{ site.url }}/clients/biodigital-human) and the Smiletrain surgical simulator, 
and built two of the leading WebGL-based IFC viewers. For more details on those activities, check out my **[resume](http://linkedin.com/in/lindsaystanleykay)** and **[portfolio]({{ site.url }}/clients/)**. 
<!-- When **working remotely** as a principle developer, I've lead for the first few releases, then as those clients  -->
<!-- gained revenue and expanded, helped them transition to an on-site lead developer. That process  -->
<!-- worked well, and was the logical way to progress as the team grew and organizational overhead increased.  -->

### Process

As a software engineer, I value process, teamwork, empathy and simple, maintainable design, because it's those things 
that make software development fun, healthy and productive. 
<br><br>
As an open source contributor, I tend to adapt code that I've developed on my own time to the needs 
of my clients. In many cases, this results in greater efficiency and a certainty of delivery. If clients require more 
help, I can bring in other WebGL developers who I've collaborated with on various open source projects. 
<!-- You can check out some of that on my **[GitHub account](http://github.com/xeolabs)**. -->

**Got a project you'd like to discuss?** Get in contact via the email address below! Please note that, after the first 
couple of meetings, we'll need to formalize things with the usual paperwork before moving forward.
