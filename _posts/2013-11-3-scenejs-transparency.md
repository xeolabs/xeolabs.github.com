#Making objects transparent

As usual, we'll point SceneJS at where you keep your plugins:
{% highlight javascript %}
SceneJS.setConfigs({
     pluginPath:"./plugins"
});
{% endhighlight %}

Then we'll create the scene below, in which the outer blue box has a transparent material which allows you to see the teapot within it.

<br><br>
The code for this example is shown below. Our outer blue box is wrapped with a ```flags``` node, which works in conjunction with
a ```material``` node to make it transparent.

{% highlight javascript %}
var scene = SceneJS.createScene({
    nodes:[

        // Set up a nice camera angle
        {
            type:"lookAt",
            eye:{ x:7, y:5, z:10 }, look:{ x:0, y:1, z:0 },

            nodes:[

                // Opaque red teapot
                {
                    type:"material",
                    color:{ r:1.0, g:0.3, b:0.3 },

                    nodes:[
                        {
                            type:"geometry/teapot"
                        }
                    ]
                }                     ,

                // Transparent blue box

                // Flags node enables transparency for our box.
                // This enables the material `alpha` to specify
                // the degree of opacity.
                {
                    type:"flags",
                    flags:{ transparent:true },

                    nodes:[

                        // Material node's 'alpha' property makes
                        // teapot 60% transparent.
                        {
                            type:"material",
                            color:{ r:0.3, g:0.3, b:1.0 },
                            alpha:0.4,

                            nodes:[
                                {
                                    type:"translate", x:1, y:2, z:1,
                                    nodes:[
                                        {
                                            type:"geometry/box",
                                            xSize:3, ySize:2, zSize:3
                                        }
                                    ]
                                }
                            ]
                        }
                    ]
                }
            ]
        }
    ]
});
{% endhighlight %}

Things to note:

* The ```transparent``` flag on the ```flags``` node around the outer blue box which enables it to be transparent.
* The ```material``` node around the blue box has an ```alpha``` of ```0.4```, which works in conjuction with the ```flags``` node to
make the box 60% transparent.
* The box would be invisible if ```alpha``` was 0.0, and opaque if ```alpha``` was 1.0.

SceneJS automatically ensures that all transparent objects are rendered *after* opaque objects. If the transparent box was
rendered before the teapot, then the teapot would not be visible because its fragments would have been rejected by the
WebGL [depth test](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z-buffering) because the pixels for the box would already be in the depth buffer,
with closer depth values. Graphics geeks will note that there may be a problem with depth buffer rejection if we have
multiple transparent objects. I'll address that in the following section on Transparency Sorting.<br><br>

When designing SceneJS, I had considered just making the ```transparent``` property on ```flags``` nodes true by default.
That way, an ```alpha``` value less than 1.0 would be sufficient to make the box transparent, no ```flags``` node required. However,
   that doesn't quite fit with alpha mapping (see tutorial on [Alpha Maps](/articles/scenejs-alpha-mapping)). We might have an ```alpha``` of 1.0, then
   have an alpha map that modifies it for fragments within the shader, which fails to create transparency for those because SceneJS has already
   determined that the geometry is opaque. That's one reason we have ```flags``` in the mix, other being that we can use them
   to easily switch transparency on and off for chunks of our scenes.<br>

### Switching transparency on and off
You can make the box opaque by flipping the ```transparent``` flag on that ```flags``` node:
{% highlight javascript %}
myScene.getNode("myFlags",
    function(flags) {
        flags.setTransparent(false);
    });
{% endhighlight %}

### Varying opacity
You can make the box less transparent my increasing the ```alpha``` on its ```material``` node:
{% highlight javascript %}
myScene.getNode("myMaterial",
    function(myMaterial) {
        myMaterial.setAlpha(0.8);
    });
{% endhighlight %}


### Picking through transparent objects
Want to be able to pick the teapot through the box? That's covered in the
tutorial on [Picking in SceneJS](/articles/scenejs-picking/#picking-through-transparent-objects).
<br><br>

# Transparency sorting

It's tricky making multiple overlapping transparent objects look good in WebGL. In this section I'll describe
the problem, some solutions that don't work so well with WebGL, and a partial solution that SceneJS provides using
prioritised render bins.

### The problem

SceneJS renders transparent objects using the standard [alpha blending technique](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_compositing),
where it combines each transparent object's translucent colour with the colours of the objects behind it.
<br><br>
As mentioned earlier, there's one catch: SceneJS may also be using the depth
buffer's Z-test to solve visibility for overlapping objects, which works by ensuring that each pixel is written to the colour
buffer only if its Z-depth is closer than any pixel already at the same location.<br><br>The example below shows the
problem. If we were to render the outer green box first, then when we try to render the inner yellow and blue boxes,
the pixels of those boxes will not be rendered, because their Z-depths are greater than the pixels already rendered for
the outer green box.

<br><br>
[![TransparencySort]({{ site.url }}/images/scenejs/transparencySort.jpg)](http://scenejs.org/examples.html?page=transparencySorting)

[Run this example](http://scenejs.org/examples.html?page=transparencySorting).
<br><br>
We therefore need to order the rendering of the boxes from the innermost box outwards, so that the
pixels of each box don't get rejected by the depth test, and thus get the chance to be blended with each other in
the colour buffer - a technique called [transparency sorting](http://www.opengl.org/wiki/Transparency_Sorting).
<br><br>

### Solutions that don't work so well in WebGL

Algorithms to find that order automatically are simple enough, but not easy to do efficiently on WebGL.

#### Painter's Algorithm or BSP? Nope.

Ideally, I would have liked to use the [painters algorithm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Painter's_algorithm), or a [BSP tree](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bsp_tree),
which would render all the faces in the scene in order from furthest face first, through to closest face last.
 <br><br>
Two show stoppers exist with that though:

 1. In WebGL we don't get that kind of granular access to individual faces. Rendering the faces of a mesh is a batch
 operation, where we bind the vertex arrays for the mesh, then do a draw call to render them in one hit.
 2. If we **were** able to draw each face individually (like we could back in the days of fixed-function OpenGL), then
  the constant switching of colours and textures for each face would make for some horrendously inefficient GPU state changes.

#### Depth peeling? Nope.

I had also considered [depth peeling](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth_peeling), which is essentially an order-independent
technique in which you render the scene multiple times, each time clipping the objects to a min-max layer, which you
 move forwards each time. Even though that's awesome for solving our problem for nested objects, like our boxes, it requires multiple
 passes on the draw list for each frame. That would severely impact SceneJS' efficiency at rendering large quantities
 of objects, which is a priority feature.
 <br>

## Solution: Ordered render bins

In the end I went for the lowest common denominator and simply allowed you to organise scene objects within ```layer``` nodes.
 These work by manually partitioning the objects into prioritised render bins, ordered so that the objects within the
 ```layer``` with the lowest priority are rendered first.<br><br>Note that since the ```layer``` node's priorities can be
 dynamically reassigned, the way is also open to support some sort of automatic object Z-sorting later if needed.
<br><br>
Let's have a look at how we use the ```layer``` nodes to render our boxes in the correct order for transparency.
<br><br>
Here's the scene that renders the nested boxes in the scene above.

{% highlight javascript %}
var scene = SceneJS.createScene({
    nodes:[

        // Mouse-orbited camera
        {
            type:"cameras/orbit", yaw:30, pitch:-30, zoom:42, zoomSensitivity:5,

            nodes:[

                // Inner opaque blue box.

                // Rendered first, within layer at priority -1.

                // Box is opaque because material has default alpha of 1.0, and box
                // is not wrapped with a flags node with a 'transparent' flag set.

                {
                    type:"layer",
                    priority:-1,

                    nodes:[
                        {
                            type:"material", color:{ r:0.2, g:0.2, b:1.0 },
                            nodes:[
                                {
                                    type:"scale", x:3, y:3, z:3,
                                    nodes:[

                                        // Box primitive
                                        {
                                            type:"geometry/box"
                                        }
                                    ]
                                }
                            ]
                        }
                    ]
                },


                // Flags around our transparent boxes

                // Enables to 'alpha' values on the materials around
                // our boxes to to cause them to be translucent.

                // Also cull backfaces on those boxes because we can't
                // control the order in which faces render. We don't want
                // front faces rendering before back faces, which would
                // cause the back faces to be rejected by the depth buffer
                // and deny the opportunity
                // to blend the faces - easy fix is just to not render the backfaces.

                {
                    type:"flags",
                    flags:{ transparent:true, backfaces:false },

                    nodes:[

                        // Middle transparent red box

                        // Rendered next, in implicit layer at priority 0

                        // We don't actually need this layer because anything
                        // not within a Anything not in a layer is actually
                        // at priority 0 implicitly.

                        // This box is transparent because its wrapped with a
                        // material having an alpha channel that's less than
                        // 1.0, which works with the 'transparent' flag.

                        {
                            type:"layer",
                            priority:0,

                            nodes:[
                                {
                                    type:"material",
                                    color:{ r:1.0, g:0.2, b:0.2 },
                                    alpha:0.2,

                                    nodes:[
                                        {
                                            type:"scale", x:6, y:6, z:6,

                                            nodes:[
                                                {

                        // This box is also transparent because its wrapped

                        {
                            type:"layer",
                            priority:1,
                            id: "greenBoxLayer",

                            nodes:[
                                {
                                    type:"material",
                                    color:{ r:0.2, g:1.0, b:0.2 },
                                    alpha:0.2,

                                    nodes:[
                                        {
                                            type:"scale", x:9, y:9, z:9,

                                            nodes:[
                                                {
                                                    type:"geometry/box"
                                                }
                                            ]
                                        }
                                    ]
                                }
                            ]
                        }
                    ]
                }
            ]
        }
    ]
});
{% endhighlight %}

Things to note:

* The boxes are wrapped with ```layer``` nodes, with ```priority``` properties set to order their rendering so that the
innermost box renders first
* Anything not within a ```layer``` node is implicitly at priority 0. The ```layer``` around the middle box is therefore
 actually redundant.

### Changing layer priorities
You can change the ```priority``` on the ```layer``` nodes at any time. Let's change the priority for the green box:
{% highlight javascript %}
myScene.getNode("greenBoxLayer",
    function(layer) {
        layer.setPriority(-2);
    });
{% endhighlight %}
That's going to make the green outermost box render before the innermost blue box, which is actually going to wreck our
 transparency sorting.
 <br><br>
**Performance tip**: changing those priorities causes SceneJS to re-sort its internal display list, so there will be a
performance hit if you do that frequently.

# Conclusion

In this tutorial I've shown you how to use the ```material``` node in conjunction with ```flags``` nodes to make geometry
   appear transparent. I also touched on the classic problem of making multiple overlapping transparent objects look good,
    and described the partial solutuion provided by SceneJS through its ```layer``` nodes, which order the rendering of geometries
     so that they alpha-blend nicely with one another.
